Magento
=======

Hi visitors. I am developing this custom module for Magento in purpose so customers could upgrade from Basic to PRO and Platinum version, or from Pro to Platinum, according their purchase items list.

I have an issue with product hiding for customers of magento system and then i googled in order to find some ideas about that. Therefore i have found extension on github. But it is hard to understand for now and I am afraid it not exactly what i need(may be i'm wrong, not sure)

My customization (module): There are some products in the store like Product BASIC, PRO and PLATINUM. And all of them has different prices, but if you have already purchased one of them, you can upgrade from BASIC to PRO or PLATINUM with cheaper prices.
I was able to create that, but here is issue that if i make hidden Category for frontend and put upgrade-able product inside it with visibility: Category only. In this case customer can see any upgrades available for him on his account page and then purchase it.
Here is the problem: If customer who can see hidden product will copy link to the product and give it away, anyone can buy this product. I need to do something to prevent this case.
